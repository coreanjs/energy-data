## Background {.smaller}

**Korea** **reverses the nuclear phase-out policy** of the previous administration.

::: fragment
-   **\[Social Change\]** Electricity demand will increase with the rapid electrification and with the increase in investments in cutting-edge industries.

    -   Supply capacity needs to be expanded for stable electricity supply, increasing the possibility of building new nuclear power plants.
:::

::: fragment
-   **\[Expected Policy\]** It is estimated that nuclear power will make up a greater part of overall power generation for 2038, once the final version of the next 11th basic plan contains plans to build new nuclear power plants.

    -   However, experts are pointing out that sufficient review and discussion should precede construction projects for large-scale nuclear power plants.
:::

## Motivation {.smaller}

**Electricity infrastructure is prone to cost overrun issues** almost independently of technology or location.

::: fragment
-   **Hydroelectric dams** and **nuclear reactors** have the greatest amount and frequency of cost overruns. [@sovacool2014]. Moreover, projections of nuclear plant costs have repeatedly failed to predict the cost overruns observed[@sovacool2014a].
:::

::: fragment
-   [@eash-gates2020] finds that **indirect expenses, largely soft costs**, contributed a majority of the cost rise. Also, this study suggests a bottom-up cost modeling mechanisms to **identify the rise in nuclear construction costs over the past five decades**.
:::

## Research questions

::: callout-note
## Research Questions are as follows

::: fragment
1.  How does capturing **the cost of nuclear capacity expansion** affect of its share of South Korea's electricity generation over time?
:::

::: fragment
2.  How does **the endogenous modeling of nuclear power plants** affect the electrification of end-use sectors?
:::

::: fragment
3.  How does **the inclusion of historically observed cost overruns for South Korea's nuclear power plants** affect electricity generation and end-use sectors?
:::
:::

## Literature Review {.smaller}

**Cost overrun expectations are usually not considered in IAMs**, but few have been implemented in some regional analysis.

::: fragment
-   A case study of **Ecuador** uses a partial equilibrium energy system optimization model**(TIMES)** to address uncertainties around investment cost overruns[@carvajal2019].

-   Using the **MESSAGE model**(COPPE-MSB), [@köberle2018] analyzes the effects of cost overruns and construction delays through 2050 on the results of a cost-optimal energy infrastructure expansion model for **Brazil**.

-   [@arbuckle2021] presents a novel endogenous representation of hydropower production in **GCAM-Canada**, and suggests the reason to be more cautious about cost overruns in electricity generation planning.
:::

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   **GCAM-Canada** study shows electricity development cost overrun magnitudes for different technology[@arbuckle2021]. However, **no Korean nuclear power plants are included in this study**.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   [@du] in 2009 update the cost of nuclear power as calculated in the MIT (2003) Future of Nuclear Power study. It includes data in **Japan** and **the Republic of Korea** as well as recently proposed plants in the **US**.

    ![](PPT_research_topic/MIT_cost_2.png)

## Research Plan {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Need to gather **cost overrun data for Korea's recently proposed nuclear power plants**.

    -   There is information from several press releases, such as [YTN(2017)](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20171024066700003), [Hankyoreh(2017)](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/813791.html), [Energy & Environment News(2020)](https://www.e2news.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=218783), concerning cost overruns in Korea's nuclear power plants.

-   Run GCAM based on Korea's available cost overrun data and analyze the results.
